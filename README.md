# Designing-an-Interface-with-PYQT-6-and-Data-Transfer-with-ROS-2.
I prepared documentation titled 'Designing an Interface with PYQT 6 and Data Transfer with ROS 2.' I focused on designing graphical user interfaces with PYQT 6 and data transfer using ROS 2, based on the knowledge I gained over the past year with the KOU ROVER team. I concentrated on data management in robotic systems and took significant steps in areas like data processing and visualization. I hope this will be a useful resource for those interested.
